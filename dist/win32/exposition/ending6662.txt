You call the old Japanese lady back into your office and tell her that she has been punished enough for her sins and that Heaven awaits her. Tears of joy roll down her face as she thanks you profusely; you tell her to follow you and you will take them to the angels. The old lady gladly falls in behind you exclaiming that this is a huge honour that she did not feel she was worthy of. Haniel gives you a nod of recognition as you approach him; at the sight of the angels she collapses to her knees in prayer. However her peaceful prayer is cut short when the angels grab her by the arm and march her to the edge of the barrier.

"What did you tell her?" inquires Haniel.

You just smile in response as the woman begins to get confused; her body is pushed up against the glowing wall. The power hums and resonates all around her and the angelic escort. In a flash of swirling light and a crackle of lightning she is pushed through to the other side of the barrier. Once again the old lady collapses to the floor in loud prayer as the Grand Demon Krazak charges towards him. The combination of the flash of light and sensing that the barrier slipped has worked the Grand Demon into a ravenous frenzy. His bright red skin smoulders and flickers like lava from a volcano, his talons long, black, pointed and deadly reach out towards the old woman. She doesn't resist the movement as Krazak tosses her up into the air before catching her in his cavernous mouth of jagged stalactites. 

The Grand Demon sits back on his haunches savouring his first meal in nearly a week. When you notice the madness leave his eyes. Something is wrong! Krazak's huge mouth turns upwards and nostrils flare as he smells the scent of a million souls. You turn to run as Haniel senses the danger, he calls to the Angels who fly up into the air and ready their weapons; preparing to fight to the Grand Demon. You push your way through the throng of souls and head towards your chamber where you hope to barricade yourself in, away from the impending doom. 

From behind you comes a ground shaking boom, glancing over your shoulder you see Krazak at full height smashing his fists against the barrier. With each thunderous punch the entire passage rattles and the barrier groans; you turn and go into a full sprint, barging through any panicked souls in your path. As you reach your chambers you hear a cacophonous crash signalling the falling of the barrier followed by a blood-chilling roar. All around the souls erupt into chaos, scrambling over one another trying to get away from Krazak. The large surge of souls knocks you off your feet, as you tumble to the ground you hear your leg snap beneath you. Unable to move you stare up at the Grand Demon causing all the chaos and knowing that this is entirely your fault. You watch as he gorges himself on souls, his powers returning with every life essence he drains. Haniel is the last of the angels still fighting, his long black hair is matted with blood and his once bright white armour is spattered with scorch marks. You watch as he launches a blast if lightning from the end of his Morningstar towards Krazak. Krazak feels the bolt clatter into his thick hide; turning to face Haniel he unleashes a flurry of dark energy which consumes Haniel. 

As the dark energy dissipates you watch as Haniel's (now empty) armour fall down to the floor. With all the resistance gone the Grand Demon unfurls his leathery wings and with an almighty down force pushes off from the ground. The world goes black and silent as you fall from this plane of existence.
