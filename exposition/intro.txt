Souls for the Grand Demon

You are a lesser demon working in Hell. Your job is to filter all the evil souls that pass from Purgatory to Hell; the souls need filtering so that the sinners go to the correct level of Hell. Once the souls enter hell they are devoured by one of the 66 Grand Demons, these Grand Demons wield unimaginable evil and will not hesitate to burn any demons who question their agenda. 

All was going smoothly until about a week ago when a good soul was misjudged and ended up being devoured by the Grand Demon Krazak. The holy power within the good soul warped Krazak’s mind and he went on a rampage of hellfire, in his feral state he sensed the millions of unjudged souls waiting in Purgatory. Any demons that stood in his way were crushed and brushed and he consumed all the wayward souls. The Angels felt the disturbance in the passageways and dispatched a legion to deal with the Grand Demon. 

A battle erupted in the passageway with the Grand Demon lashing out at the Angels; many of the Seraphs fell to Krazak but a barrier was erected in time to contain him within the passage. Whilst preventing Krazak from entering Purgatory, the barrier also prevents all the souls from entering hell. A week has passed and Krazak is still not in his right mind; he stalks the barrier constantly, probing for weaknesses and refusing to reenter hell. The 65 other Grand Demons are reaching breaking point; they need a constant stream of souls to maintain their power. 

Time is of the essence if you are to prevent the Grand Demons of Hell from being unable to control their power. There is also the pressing issue of Purgatory becoming overpopulated with the millions of evil souls that can’t get into Hell.
